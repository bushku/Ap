<h2>Write about how you plan to use what you learned in this lesson to improve your CPT project.</h2>
<!--<p>My CPT is not a website so this doesn't really apply to my project. If it was, I would add the Bootstrap resource to my HTML `<head>` and use some of the Bootstrap classes such as `container` to style my project.</p>-->

<h1>Customization 1</h1>

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
Effective wireframes provide clear indication of intended interactivity and are feasible to implement in code. The user experience must also flow in a logical manner so as not to distract the user from the content.
<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
User testing plays a large role in user interface design because, after all, the interface is designed specifically for the user. One method that websites often use to test interface design is A/B testing. Companies will selectively enable or disable certain UI features/updates for a group of users and collect statistics on whether their product is more successful (gets more clicks, etc.). Once a feature is confirmed to show significant statistical evidence of being more effective than the current design, it gets implemented for all users.
